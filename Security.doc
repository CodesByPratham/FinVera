🧹 What is Sanitization?
Sanitization means cleaning or escaping potentially dangerous input, especially:
Scripts (<script>)
SQL injection ('; DROP TABLE users;--)
HTML content (XSS attacks)
In Spring Boot:
If you're not rendering HTML (e.g., only JSON), sanitization is less of a concern
Still, you should avoid blindly trusting input, especially for:
Search
Logging
Sending emails
Uploading files
You can sanitize manually using libraries like:
Apache Commons StringEscapeUtils
ESAPI
JSoup (for HTML input)



❌ Invalidate Tokens on Logout or Password Change
Problem:
JWTs are stateless — the server does not store them. So if a token is issued and:
The user logs out
The user changes their password
Their account is disabled
🚫 The old token still works until it expires.

✅ Solutions:
1. Use a Token Blacklist (Database or Cache)
Store active tokens or their IDs (jti) in Redis or DB. 
On logout, delete the token from that store. 
On every request, check if token is blacklisted. 
if (blacklist.contains(jwtId)) {
   throw new UnauthorizedException("Token is revoked.");
}
This solves:
Logout invalidation
Forceful logouts by admin
Token revocation after suspicious activity

2. Rotate Tokens on Password Change
On password change:
Invalidate old tokens (blacklist or use tokenVersion)
Force user to log in again

3. Add a field like tokenVersion to User
Include tokenVersion in JWT claim
If user changes password, increment the field in DB
On request, compare token’s version vs DB version



🔐 4. Security Headers
Add HTTP headers to protect against XSS, clickjacking, etc.
http.headers(headers -> headers
    .contentSecurityPolicy("default-src 'self'")
    .xssProtection(xss -> xss.block(true))
    .frameOptions(frame -> frame.sameOrigin())
);


🔐 6. Account Lockout & Login Attempt Throttling
🚫 Prevent brute-force attacks by:
Limiting login attempts
Locking account temporarily after 5-10 failed logins
Rate Limiting OTP Requests (Forgot & Resend)
How: Track OTP generation attempts (e.g., max 5 per hour).
Where: In forgotPassword() and resendOtp().
(Can be done using Redis or DB flags)
Use a combination of IP address + email tracking.



🔐 8. Database Security
🔐 Use strong DB passwords and restrict DB access only to backend server.
🎯 Limit privileges of the PostgreSQL user (avoid superuser rights).
🧹 Enable automatic cleanup of old OTP tokens, stale sessions, logs.



🔐 9. Email Abuse Protection
⏳ Throttle OTP/email requests to avoid spam.
🔐 Use rate-limiting or cool down logic (e.g., max 3 OTPs per 15 mins).
🔐 10. Sensitive Data Masking
Avoid exposing sensitive fields (e.g., password hashes, tokens) in any response.
Use DTOs to prevent accidental field leaks from entities.
