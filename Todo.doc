ðŸ‘¤ 3. Profile Module
Add GET /api/users/me to fetch logged-in user data.
Add PUT /api/users/me to update:
name
phone
(optionally) password (with old password verification)
Okay so we are going to now implement the functionality of Update profile for user.
Three new fields we are going to take from user which is gender, dob and profile pic.
User cannot and will never be able to update email(Admin can but will implement admin later).
User can update name, phone, dob, gender and password.
For updating the password user has to provide old and new password to update the password.

âœ… 7. Notifications Module
Let user receive alerts:
Password changed
New login from new device/IP
Weekly financial summaries (Finvera-specific)
